# Question 10 (Chapter 9):

# Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square.
# The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument.
# Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape
# where Shape's area is 0 by default.Hints:To override a method in super class,
# we can define a method with the same name as in the super class.
